This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

<!-- so i am trying to build a nocode API builder SaaS/BaaS platform that lets user build endpoints rapidly. these endpoints are already hosted and deployed. user does not have to worry about db instance and hosting, server deployments. they dont have to write code in node/express as well. everything here is UI based. they can use our UI to create tables, write queries, etc.
Help me build the entire landing page for this platform but first lets just start with Hero section. Think carefully what the UI would look like. I need a clean elegant UI. My primary users might be developers or maybe be non-tech people who are looking for some nocode backend solutions. i have bought domain "thincrust.io" for this. you may take inspiration from other saas solutions for this hero section. I am attaching 3 screenshots below for inspiration. You are allowed to even literally copy and mix any designs that you see fit. -->
